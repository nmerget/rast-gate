# Rastgate ‚è∞ü•Ö

---

Rastgate is a simple electron + react app to document working times and monitor them. Whenever you lock your screen a new break will be added to the current day. When you unlock your screen it automatically ends the break.

Add the build app to your startup-apps to generate a new time when your start your computer. The rest should be automated.

To see the `json` file with all your times look at:

- Windows: `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\rast-gate\storage\rast-gate-times.json`
- Mac: TODO
